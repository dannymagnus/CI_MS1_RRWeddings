                    Painting is my passion!<br>
                    I love creating design that are truly unique and personal, my favourite parts of the design process
                    is being
                    able to incorporate meaningful illustrations so it becomes more than a piece of paper.</p>

                I began my career with my degree in illustration, and my love of painting and illustrating detailed
                watercolour images led me down the path of wedding stationery. After i had the pleasure of doing some
                invitations for close friends I knew i would really love helping other couples create their dream
                stationery.
                </p>
                <p>
                All of my illustrations are hand painted (by myself!) so you will always have invitations that have been
                lovingly and passionately crafted. My inspiration comes from nature and the outdoors, and I love to put
                my paintbrush to paper to create intricate floral designs or beautiful watercolour washes that can be
                transferred to a set of stationery for your special day.
