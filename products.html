                                            Once your order has been placed with receipt of your deposit/full payment, Rebecca Richards Designs (RR) will provide you with a date for when the design process is due to commence and at which stage any remaining payment is due. It is important that you notify RR immediately if you are unable to work to the schedule as any delay in supplying feedback, providing copy or approving proofs/artwork may result in a delay to your order. Rebecca Richards Designs aims to complete orders as soon as possible but as a guide please allow the following timelines for orders:
                                        </p>

                                            Customisable designs - the design and print turnaround is 4 weeks for all customisable collection designs, semi-custom designs are 4-6 weeks. Orders should ideally be placed 2-3 months before you wish to send out your save the dates or invitations so your order can be scheduled in advance.
                                        </p>

                                            Bespoke design service - bespoke design turnaround times vary depending on the complexity of the design and print finish. It is advised that for a bespoke design you place your order at least 3 - 4 months before you wish to send out your save the dates or invitations. The design process takes approximately 8 - 12 weeks but can be more during busy periods.
                                        </p>

                                            Wedding day stationery - depending on the number of items to design and the finish it is advised that all wedding day stationery is ordered no later than 8 weeks prior to your wedding date. I aim to have orders delivered no later than 1 week prior to the wedding date but this is only possible where enough notice has been provided and the required information/feedback has been provided on time.
                                        </p>

                                            Once final proofs have been approved the remainder of the balance will be due before printing will begin.

RR cannot be held responsible for any delay to delivery as a result of late payment.

                                            Digital proofs will be sent via email, unless specifically requested. Great care is taken to ensure all information is accurate, however it is ultimately the responsibility of the customer to check layout, copy, spelling and grammar.
                                        </p>
                                        <h5>PLEASE ENSURE ALL OF YOUR TEXT IS DOUBLE (AND TRIPLE) CHECKED FOR SPELLING, GRAMMAR AND PUNCTUATION BEFORE YOU APPROVE THE FINAL DRAFT.</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            If designs are approved with type errors and subsequently printed RR takes no responsibility, and will not be liable for any resulting cost. If replacements are required, then they will be charged for in full. It is therefore of the upmost importance that you check all spelling and copy thoroughly before approving any designs.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Please note that the colour on your screen may differ from printed colour, each screen is calibrated differently and this is particularly noticeable on mobile devices. Please bear in mind that printers also vary and that your final stationery will be printed on the highest quality professional printers therefore the colours may differ slightly. If pantone colour targets have been specified this is just a visual guide and it is not possible to accurately match Pantone colours using a digital CMYK print process.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Agate slices will also have variations in colour and size.

                                        <p>
                                            Design and proofing takes time and this has been factored in to the cost. RR will provide up to 3 free digital proofs and up to 3 proof revisions for each order, thereafter proofs will be charged at £30.00 each. It is recommended that you carefully check the design and content and clearly notify RR of any information that needs to be amended straight away.

                                            There is a minimum order of 35 invitations or Save the Date cards due to the time involved in creating artwork and printer minimum quantities. There is a minimum order of 50 (of each item) for all hot foil, letterpress or debossing/embossing prints. It is advisable to order both day and evening invitations at the same time to avoid any additional special order fees. If an additional order is received for fewer than 35 of an item, an individual quote will be given as printing costs are higher for short runs.

                                        <h5>HOW IS YOUR DATA STORED AND PROTECTED</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            All contact details and personal data is stored on my personal password protected home computer and hard drive. Any invitations that have names and addresses are stored in a locked cabinet in my home address and are never published on this website or social media with these details.
                                        </p>
                                        <!--Data retention subsection-->
                                        <h5>DATA RETENTION</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            I will only retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes I collected it for, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When deciding what the correct time is to keep the data for I look at its amount, nature and sensitivity, potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure, the processing purposes, if these can be achieved by other means and legal requirements. For tax purposes the law requires me to keep basic information about my customers (including Contact, Identity, Financial and Transaction Data) for six years after they stop being customers.
                                        </p>
                                        <!--Data sharing subsection-->
                                        <h5>WHO YOUR INFORMATION IS SHARED WITH</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            I will never sell or disclose any of your information to any third parties that aren’t essential to my ordering or business process and I only allow such third parties to process your personal data for specified purposes and in accordance with my instructions.
                                        </p>
                                        <!--Statutory rights subsection-->
                                        <h5>YOUR RIGHTS</h5>
                                        <p>
                                            Under data protection laws you have rights in relation to your personal data that include the right to request access your data and to withdraw consent.  If you wish to do this, please email me at beckielrichards@gmail.com.  You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights). However, I may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive or refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.  I may need to request specific information from you to help me confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it.
                                        </p>
